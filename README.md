# Unity Save System

Unity Save System is an all-in-one save system for Unity 2021+. The current usage is exclusive to scripts. It is designed to be easy to use for less experienced C# users and with minimal boilerplate code and works out of the box without any setup more than what data to save. It saves to a binary file using [Odin Serializer](https://github.com/TeamSirenix/odin-serializer), which allows the user to serialize almost any type.
